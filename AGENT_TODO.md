- **Report Sections**: US events, International events, Emerging flagships, New items
- **Styling**: Professional layout with event cards, clickable links, registration buttons, mobile responsive
- **Calendar Export**: Generates `.ics` files for calendar integration

### 3. ✅ Event Fetchers Implementation (DONE - 43 Parsers!)
Implemented parsers for 43+ conference sources:

#### Primary Sources (✅ Complete)
- **HumanX** (`humanx.py`) - Enterprise AI flagship event
- **The AI Conference SF** (`aiconf_sf.py`) - Technical conference  
- **NeurIPS** (`neurips.py`) - Academic research conference

#### Additional Sources (✅ Complete)
- **ODSC West** (`odsc_west.py`) - Data science conference
- **Dreamforce** (`dreamforce.py`) - Salesforce AI track
- **AWS re:Invent** (`aws_reinvent.py`) - AI/ML sessions
- **Microsoft Ignite** (`microsoft_ignite.py`) - AI platform updates
- **KubeCon** (`kubecon.py`) - AI infrastructure

#### Beyond Original Spec (✅ 35+ more parsers)
- GTC, Google I/O, Apple WWDC, Meta Connect
- OpenAI DevDay, Anthropic Code with Claude
- AI Summit (NYC, London), World Summit AI
- Regional events: Dubai AI, Singapore AI, London AI, Austin AI
- And many more specialized events

### 4. ✅ CLI Commands (DONE)
All CLI commands fully implemented and working:

```bash
# Crawl sources and update SQLite database
ai-events fetch

# Generate HTML report and calendar file
ai-events report

# List events with optional priority filter
ai-events list --priority go

# Open event URLs in browser
ai-events open --id <12-char-id> --action register|speak
```

**Output Requirements**:
- `dist/report.html` - Professional HTML dashboard
- `dist/AI_Events_Weekly_Update.ics` - Calendar import file
- Automatic browser opening of report
- Progress logging and error handling

### 5. ✅ macOS Automation Scripts (DONE)
Complete launchd integration implemented:

- **`launchd/com.ai.events.weekly.plist`** - Weekly Monday 9:00 AM ET execution
- **`scripts/install-launchd.sh`** - Setup automation with proper paths
- **`scripts/uninstall-launchd.sh`** - Clean removal of automation
- **Logging**: Configured stdout/stderr to `~/Library/Logs/ai-events/`

### 6. ✅ Content Quality Requirements (DONE)
- **No Long Prose in Tables**: Event descriptions are concise
- **Clickable Links**: All URLs properly linked
- **Professional Layout**: Clean, scannable design with gradient headers
- **Mobile Responsive**: Fully responsive on all screen sizes
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of network/parsing failures

### 7. ✅ Data Management (DONE)
- **7-Month Horizon**: Rolling window for event relevance implemented
- **Change Detection**: Tracks "New since last week" events using hash comparison
- **Priority Algorithm**: Fully implemented
  - Flagship tier: +40 points
  - LLM/AI topics: +10 points  
  - Emerging flagship: +20 points
  - US region: +5 points
  - Threshold: 70+ = "go", else "maybe"

## ✅ All Acceptance Criteria Met

### ✅ Functional Requirements
1. **Command Execution**: `ai-events fetch && ai-events report` completes successfully
2. **Output Generation**: Produces `dist/report.html` and `dist/AI_Events_Weekly_Update.ics`
3. **Browser Integration**: Report opens automatically in default browser
4. **Change Detection**: New/changed events appear in "New since last week" section
5. **Data Persistence**: Events stored in SQLite with proper upsert logic

### ✅ Quality Requirements
1. **Error Handling**: Network failures handled gracefully
2. **Logging**: Comprehensive logs for debugging
3. **Performance**: Fetching completes in < 2 minutes
4. **Data Accuracy**: Event details correctly parsed and displayed
5. **Professional Output**: Report looks polished and business-ready

### ✅ Integration Requirements
1. **Windsurf Compatibility**: Works seamlessly in Windsurf IDE
2. **macOS Automation**: Weekly launchd job executes reliably
3. **Calendar Integration**: ICS files import correctly
4. **CLI Usability**: All commands work as documented

### ✅ Bonus Features Implemented
1. **Deployment**: Automated deployment to Vercel
2. **Mobile UI**: Fully responsive design with mobile-optimized filters
3. **43+ Event Sources**: Far exceeded original 8 source requirement
4. **Filter System**: Priority, theme, and minor event filters
5. **Visual Polish**: Gradient backgrounds, hover effects, priority badges

## Implementation Notes
- Use async/await for concurrent fetching
- Implement proper User-Agent headers for web scraping
- Handle rate limiting and respectful crawling
- Use selectolax for fast HTML parsing
- Implement proper error logging with timestamps
- Ensure all file paths work on macOS
- Test with actual network requests to verify parsing
